# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life
# The rules for this game of life are: 
# Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by exposure. 
# Any live cell with two live neighbours lives on to the next generation. 
# Any live cell with three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. 
# Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. 
# Neighbours are any two triangles that shares a side.
